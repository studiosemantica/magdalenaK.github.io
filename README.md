## Project Description

For our first General Assembly project, we are creating portfolio websites to showcase our work. I want to have a minimal and clean design, that accentuates flow and design trends. I want to create sections that will describe the disciplines I specialize in addition to showcasing my projects. I hope to additionally incorporate a technical skills section that will detail my knowledge of tech tools beyond the project requirements.
